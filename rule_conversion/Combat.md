The core of Combat is based on Delta Green's combat system. The following are the modifications added by NBA.

# Damage
Damage is determined by the damage die of the weapon used, along with the melee damage modifier based on your strength score. Past 24 [[STR]], damage continues to increase at a rate of +1 every 3 STR points. For weapon damage, see [[Weapons Tables]].

| 1-4 | 5-8 | 9-12 | 13-16 | 17-20 | 21-24 |

| -2  | -1  | 0    | +1    | +2    | +3    | 
# Combat Pool
For every 20% an agent has in a given combat skill (Melee Weapons, Unarmed Combat, Firearms), they receive 1 Combat Pool point for that ability per combat. This is similar to the [[Chases#Chase Pool|Chase Pool]] rules.
## Thriller Rules
### Extra Attacks
Spending 3 Combat Pool points for Unarmed Combat and Melee Weapons or 4 Combat Pool points for Firearms will let you take a second attack in a round of combat. If the second attack is against a different target, roll with -20%. Requires 80% in the given combat ability
### Feints
Using Unarmed Combat Or Melee Weapons, you can spend up to 3 Combat Pool points to raise any other attacks against a given enemy in a turn by 10% times the number of spent Combat Pool points. You cannot apply multiple Feints to the same target
### Jumping In
Spending 3 points of any Combat Pool ability will allow you to jump forward in the turn order and act at the end of the current character's action. You may forgo your action and Jump In without paying any points at any time (this is identical to Delta Green's Wait action).
### Martial Arts
Once per fight you may refresh 3 Unarmed Combat pool points by describing your actions. Requires 80% Unarmed Combat
### Mook Shield
TODO: See how this compares with DG's Pin ability
### Reckless Attacks
TODO: This uses Athletics points, see how this compares to chase pool, may ignore
### Smashes And Throws
Spending 2 Unarmed Combat pool points allows you to Smash or Throw an opponent. You must still succeed on the Unarmed Combat roll to hit the opponent
#### Smash
Smash your opponent into something, a breakable or hard object does X damage, a hard and protruding object does Y damage TODO: Figure out good damage numbers
#### Throw
Throwing a character at a hard or breakable object does X damage. Throwing a character into a hard and projecting object does Y damage (both of these should be slightly less than their Smash counterparts). A character can be thrown up to 2 meters away and must make a [[Core Stats|DEX]] test to avoid landing prone. On a critical, a character can be thrown through a window or other small gap. A DEXx3 test can be used to attempt to grab the frame and avoid the fall. TODO: Find damage numbers for all this.
### Special Weapons Training
TODO: Decide if this should be incorporated, and if so, how to get the training
### Support Moves
Not using
### Suppressive Fire
See DG. Suppression rules. TODO: Incorporate both?

### Technothriller Monologue
Regain 3 Firearms Combat Pool points per fight by describing your actions. Requires 80% in Firearms
