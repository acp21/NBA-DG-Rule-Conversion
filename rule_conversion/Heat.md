Heat is the measurement of attention that is currently on the player characters. Heat starts at 1. The entire team shares the same Heat level.

# Gaining Heat
Heat is gained through overt actions that may attract attention. The following are examples of what may cause Heat gain. Completely covering up an action will prevent all Heat from said action. Partially covering up the action will modify the Heat gain by -1. See [[#Shifting Blame]] for more info.

# Effects Of Heat
Once per session, an agent must make a Heat roll using a given skill of his choice to avoid additional scrutiny for that session. This roll loses 5% per Heat level. IE. a Heat of 4 would impart a -20% penalty on the role. If the Heat role fails, the agents experience some negative side effect from the increased scrutiny during the session.
## Heat And Difficulty
Anything that the agents want to do stealthily will have a 5% reduction on the roll per level of Heat (Sneaking past the cops, Digital Intrusion to break into databases, Cover to sneak onto planes, Network to arrange gun deals or safe houses)
### Heat And The Black Market
TODO:
## Losing Heat
Heat can be lost in the following ways
### Elapsed Time
72 Hours without police or official sights reduces heat by 1. Another week drops heat by 1 again. Three months drops heat by 1 again. This time is reset if spotted by police, officials, leaving a trail, or a failed Heat roll. If using Heat By Juridstiction rules, only 1 point of Heat can be lost this way.
### Changing Jurisdiction
Heat drops by jursdiction based on the following table

| Relation                   | Heat Reduction |
| -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Closely associated country | -1             |
| Fellow EU member or custom | -2             |
| Other country              | -3             |
| Remote or isolated country | -4               |
### Protection
An agent can create a Network contact to reduce their heat. Making a network roll against the Heat level will reduce the Heat level by the difference, assuming the roll passes. The players may also receive protection by doing a favour or mission for a powerful NPC. In some jurisdictions, Excessive Funds is enough to bribe for protection.
### Shifting Blame
Pinning the blame on someone else can lower Heat. Using skills like Criminology to fake a gange massacre, Digital Intrusion to change surveillance footage, or Stealth to plant evidence. The amount of Heat removed is dependent on thoroughness and speed. Done in time, this will completely prevent any Heat.
