# Chase Pool
Chases utilise the new Combat Pool system. For every x% (TODO: Determine this) points a character has in the 3 combat skills (Unarmed Combat, Melee Weapons, and Firearms) and the three chase skills (Athletics, Driving, and Piloting) they receive a point in a temporary "Combat Pool." These points can then be spent in combat and chases to use new abilities. The Combat Pool starts at it's maximum capacity at the beginning of every combat and chase. If a chase ends in the pursuer catching up to the runner and initiating combat, the Combat Pool does not refill.
# Overview
Chases are taken from the *Thriller Chases* rules described on NBA p. 55. Chases consist of two parties, the pursuer and the runner. Each individual will roll a d6 (potentially augmented by a spend from the Combat Pool) against a set difficulty level and adjust Lead based on the results of the rolls.
# Chases
The following is the standard procedure for a Chase sequence.
## Simultaneous Reveal
Both parties determine their spend in secret. They then reveal them simultaneously and roll a d6. The Lead is then modified based if the pursuer succeeds, the runner succeeds, or they both succeed or fail.
## The Lead
The Lead represents an abstract dramatic state of the chase. Once the Lead reaches 0 or 10 (or the value the Director has set), the chase ends, with the pursuer or runner winning respectively. The required maximum lead to escape may be modified depending on conditions like visibility and chances of escape.
### Beginning Lead
The Lead begins halfway between 0 and the runner's goal (usually 5), unless some occurrence increases or decreases it.
## Speed and Manoeuvrability
Depending on certain conditions, a given participant may be faster or more manoeuvrable than the other. For vehicle chases, please see the Vehicle Table below. If two vehicles have the same speed or manoeuvrability, the one lower down on the table is better. In a foot chase, the participant that is less heavily armoured is faster. If both participants have the same armour rating, the one with the higher Athletics score is faster. The participant with the higher [[Core Stats|DEX]] score is more manoeuvrable.
## Chase Conditions
An Open Chase is one on flat ground, good roads, clear weather, etc... Adjust the starting Lead by 1 in favour of the faster participant. The faster participant also gets to add the difference between his Speed on the Vehicle Table and that of his opponent to his chase die rolls; minimum +1

A Normal Chase is one with some hills, twists, bumps, buildings, traffic, and so forth. The faster participant gets to add +1 to his die rolls. If only one participant has the given chase ability at 80% or higher, he gets to add +1 to his chase die rolls.

A Cramped Chase is one in narrow streets, rush hour traffic, mountain roads, stormy weather, etc. Adjust the starting Lead by 1 in favour of the more manoeuvrable participant. The more manoeuvrable participant also gets to add the difference between his Maneuver rating on the Vehicle Table and that of his opponent to his chase ability die rolls; minimum +1.
## Contest Result Table
The Following table shows the modification to the Lead based on the result of any chase contest die roll

| Pursuer | Runner  | Result                                                          |
| ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Success | Fail    | Lead -2                                                         |
| Fail    | Success | Lead +2                                                         |
| Same    | Same    | Lead alters by 1 based on higher margin of success (or failure) |                                                    |
## Raises
Before the next round of chase begins, the runner can increase both difficulties by 1 by doings something dangerous or challenging (Driving into traffic, taking mountain curves quickly, running out onto a projecting girder in an unfinished apartment block). Depending on the result of that round, the difficulty may be raised or lowered based on the following table

| Pursuer    | Runner  | Modification         | Decider                              |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Irrelevant | Fail    | Drops                | NA                                   |
| Fail       | Success | Keep or Lower        | Runner                               |
| Success    | Success | Raise, Keep or Lower | Runner (Pursuer must agree to lower) | 

### Attacking During Chases
Passengers in or on a vehicle may fire a weapon at -20% during a chase round (remember to check vehicle cover). The pursuer or runner in a chase may make an attack at -20% during a round by spending 3 points from the Combat: Firearms pool the respective chase pool, or a combination of the two. This increases the difficulty of the given chase round by 1. 
#### Shooting Out Tires
Shooting out tires or other vulnerable parts of a vehicle requires a Called Shot (The penalty for the Called Shot and the above penalty for attacking in a Chase stack). Loss of a tire increases difficulty of driving rolls by 1 (or -20% outside of chases). Losing 2 tires results in a crash. Solid or "run-flat" tires face no penalty when loss of 1 tire, and losing 2 tires increases difficulty by driving rolls by 1 (or -20% outside of chases).
### Other Abilities
During a chase any player character can use other abilities to provide benefits or detriments to either side of the chase. This requires a roll. Each ability can only be used once per chase, if one agent uses a given ability, another agent cannot use the same ability. The effects of this are based on the following table

| Effect                    | Condition                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Partial Refresh           | When the benefit is abstract                      |
| Difficulty Adjustment     | Positional or tactical advantage                  |
| Opposition Spends First   | Forcing the enemy to slow down or be predictable  |
| Opposition Pool Reduction | Putting the other side at a dramatic disadvantage |
| Lead Change               | Putting the agents at a dramatic advantage        |
| Special Rule Setup        | Prepare for Swerve or Sudden escape easier or earlier than usual                                                  |
### Ramming
A ram can only be attempted at Lead 1 or 2. Attempting a ram costs 3 points from their chase pool before any spends. The player will also roll, whether they are evading a ram or attempting to ram someone else. The results of a ram attempt are based on the following table.
The base difficulty of a ram attempt is 4. On defence player adds vehicle's maneuver to the die roll + spends
On offence the player add vehicles maneuver to the difficulty (this includes vehicles with negative maneuver)

| Player Side    | Roll             | Result                                                                                   |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Defense | Fail             | Lead alters by 1, oppositions favor                                                      |
| Defense | Nat. 1 + Fail    | Car Crash                                                                                |
| Defense | Success          | Rammer must spend 2 chase points, if lacking, Lead alters in players favor by difference |
| Offense | Fail             | 2 point spend, difference alters lead in oppositions favor                               |
| Offense | Success          | Lead alters by 1, players favor                                                          |
| Offense | Nat. 6 + Success | Force opposition into car crash                                                                                         |
### Sudden Escape
Unused, see NBA p. 59 for details.
### Swerve
Unused, See NBA p. 59
### Changing Drivers
Spending 2 points of your chase ability allows a change of driver. The new driver (NPC or player) becomes the runner/pursuer.
### Multiple Pursuers
TODO: NBA p. 57
### Three-Party Chases
Run each chase (group 1 chasing group 2 and group 2 chasing group 3) as their own chases, each with a separate Lead track. Chase pools of the middle group are shared between the two chases.
# Extended Chases
Extended chases include the rules for long chases that take place over multiple days or over multiple regions.
