# Sanity
Sanity is the measurement of your agents connection to reality. It is scored on a range from 0 to 99. At 0, your agent goes permanently insane.
# Recovering Sanity
## Sources of Stability
Your agent may have several different connections to the world which help them stay sane. These are your Symbol of Respite, Person of Solace, and Place of Safety.

| Source | Time Required | Sanity Regained | Sanity Lost |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Symbol | Minutes       | 1             | 1D4         |
| Solace | 6 Hours       | 1D4             | 1D6         | 
| Safety | 1 Day         | 1D6            | 1D8        |
### Symbol of Respite
This is a non-human representation of something you value. a religious medal or crucifix, your country’s flag or your father’s dog tag, a picture of your innocent niece or a voice mail from your dead wife.
### Person of Solace
This is an actual person. Your solace has a bond level which starts at the value of your [[Core Stats|CHA]] score. If this hits 0 or the solace is physically killed or turned to the opposition, your agent loses their benefit and further loses 2D8 SAN

### Place of Safety
This is a physical location. Visiting this location for 1 day is enough to recover 1D10 SAN. Visiting this location is very bad tradecraft, and you are highly likely to be witnessed when going there depending on your heat.

## Drives
Each agent has a drive, once per session you may declare that a given action you take follows your drive, and at the Director's discretion regain 1D6 SAN

| Drive              | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Altruism           | Protect the innocent, do the right thing            |
| Atonement          | Redeem yourself from some sin                       |
| Comradeship        | Support your team, build bonds                      |
| Mystery            | Work to solve some mystery                          |
| Nowhere Else To Go |                                                     |
| Patriotism         | Support your country in any way possible            |
| I Never Left       |                                                     |
| Programming        |                                                     |
| Restoration        | Work to rejoining your old agency                   |
| Revenge            | Seek vengeance on some group that hurt you          |
| Slayer             | Your life's work is to kill vampires                |
| Collector          |                                                     |
| Thrill-Seeker      | Adrenaline Junkie, Cheat death, take risks          |
| Transparency       | Truth needs to be free, collect and reveal evidence |
## Preventing Sanity Loss
At anytime that you would otherwise lose sanity, you can roll 1D4 and subtract 1D4 from your current WP and Solace Score to prevent the loss of that much sanity.

### Preventing Temporary Insanity
Anytime you would experience an acute disorder episode or temporary insanity, you may spend 1D4 WP and Solace Score to prevent the episode

# Willpower
Willpower represents your current mental strength to continue onward despite exhaustion.

## Low Willpower
An agent whose WP goes to 2 or less has an emotional breakdown, they roll all skills at -20% until WP rises above 2

## Running Out Of Willpower
An agent at 0 WP loses all control. An agent with 0 WP is in complete control of the Director and automatically fails all tests, including SAN tests. Eventually, the agent will collapse and fall asleep long enough to regain any WP

## Regaining Willpower
An agent who gets a full night's sleep (but no more than once in a 24-hour period), he regains 1D6 WP

## Exhaustion
