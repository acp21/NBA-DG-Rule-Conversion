# Overview
The entire team's finances will be tracked as a number in USD, always divisible by 100. Any given item will be broken down into one of a few different expense levels, of which the actual value of the item is decided upon based on the circumstance by the director. The following table shows the expense levels

| Level      | Cost          |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| Incidental | < 300         |
| Standard   | 300 - 1000    |
| Unusual    | 1000 - 6000   |
| Major      | 6000 - 30,000 |
| Extreme    | 30,000+       | 

The cost for any given item is given in the *Agent's Handbook* p. 96-102.
## Acquiring Gear
## Crafting
Given the proper materials, an agent with the **Craft** ability is able to craft gear at one expense level lower than it would usually be found at. The agent must be able to craft that type of item.
## Buying
Legal  items can simply be purchased in a store. Some items that are semi-restricted, such as firearms, may require agents to provide form of identification to purchase, potentially attracting law enforcement or raising heat.
### The Black Market
Some completely illegal items must be purchased on the black market. **Streetwise** and **Criminology** can be used to find a dealer to sell a given item. Most items can be found on the Dark Web, but **INTx5** or **Cryptography** is required to avoid having your network traffic sniffed. [[Heat]] may impact a sellers potential to double cross the buyers due to desperation. A Luck roll is needed to determine if an item on the black market has an increased price
### Network
**Network** can be used to create a Network contact that has access to the gear, the more expensive the gear the higher the difficulty is.
