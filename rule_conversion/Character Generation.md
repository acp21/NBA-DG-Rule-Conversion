# The Process
Creating characters is rather simple, it follows closely to the base Delta Green character generation rules found in the *Agents Handbook* p. 16. Follow the below steps to create your character. 
## Assumptions
Each character in the *Dracula Dossier* is assumed to be a retired intelligence agent of some sort. Perhaps you were a burned spy working for the CIA, an old FBI analyst that retired after a long career, or a KGB Black Bagger on the run from your previous employers. Your agent may or may not still be operating in underground gray market crime networks. The only given is that the they *no longer are employed by an official agency.* Be creative!
## Starting Details
> [!info]
> The following is information on detailing small flavor details for your agent, if you would like, you can finish this after defining the mechanical details

Fill out the boxes at the top of the sheet defining your agents Name, Profession, Employer, Nationality, Sex, Age, and Educational and Occupational History. More detail is given below.
### Name
Self explanatory, your agent will also need a codename or "workname." This is usually a single word that will primarily be used to refer to your agent.
### Profession
Whatever job your agent used to do. This is likely related to the agency they previously worked for
### Employer
The agency that your agent used to work for.
>[!info]
> While its probably easier to keep it simple using agencies people have heard of (FBI, CIA, MI6, KGB, BND, etc...) a comprehensive list of the worlds intelligence networks can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_intelligence_agencies)
### Age
Self explanatory. For date of birth reference, game play will start on June 5, 2017. An agent starting play at age 30 would be born on June 5,  1987
### Nationality
Your agent's country of origin, this can either be where they are originally from or where they have moved to.
### Sex
Self explanatory
### Education and Occupational History
This can be any details you would like regarding your agents previous work. It could be related to jobs they did outside of the intelligence world, their high school or college education, or any other details you would like to fill in
## Distribute Stats
Distribute a pool of 72 stat points between the three primary statistics, STR, CON, DEX, INT, POW, and CHA. Each one of these should have a score between 3-18.
### Calculate Derived Attributes
Based on the above stats, calculate your characters derived attributes, HP, WP, SAN, and BP (Breaking Point). Formulas for the following are found below

| Attribute | Formula                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| HP        | (STR + CON) / 2 (round down) |
| WP        | WP is equal to POW           |
| SAN       | POW X 5                      |
| BP        | SAN - POW                    | 

## Sources of Stability
Your sources of stability are the pillars tying your character to reality. They have three types, a Symbol of Stability, a Place of Safety, and a Person of Solace. They are defined below

| Source | Description                                                                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Symbol | A physical item (grandma's old locket, my police badge, the last note my wife wrote before she died) |
| Safety | A specific location, (chilhood treehouse in Berlin, church I was married in at Budapest)                                                                                                     |
| Solace | A specific person, (my son, my husband, my old handler)                                                                                                    |
Your Solace has an extra space for a score, this score starts equal to your CHA score. You will also choose a Drive for your agent, or an idea that keeps them going. The table for drives can be seen below. Spending time with any of your sources or following your drive will help your agent recover sanity

| Drive              | Description                                         |

| Comradeship        | Support your team, build bonds                      |
| Mystery            | Work to solve some mystery                          |
| Patriotism         | Support your country in any way possible            |

| Transparency       | Truth needs to be free, collect and reveal evidence |
## Choose Skills
You have 650 skill points to distribute among ALL skills. You may place them in any configuration you want, however no skill can go above 80% at character creation. 
### Languages
Languages are each learned individually. They each have two levels, Rudimentary (R) or Fluent (F). An agent that speaks a language at the Rudimentary level knows enough to travel, they can communicate about basic context and get the general ideas of what someone is trying to say. Technical or specialized communication is beyond them. A Fluent agent can speak a given language just as well as any native speaker.

At character creation, you may spend your points to define langauges you know. Each ten points you spend gets you a Rudimentary language, and each 20 points you spend gets you a Fluent language. These can be defined in play. IE. you can put 50 points into your character when building them to define that you have 2 fluent and 1 rudimentary language. At any point during gameplay, you can decide what those languages are.
### Unique Skills
For each 20% in each of the below skills, your agent can create, make, or pilot one type of thing. Similar to languages, these can be defined during play.

| Skill    | Extra                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Art      | Create 1 type of art (pottery, painting, dance, etc)   |
| Craft    | Craft 1 type of item (Gunsmithing, Electronics, etc..) |
| Piloting | Pilot 1 type of vehicle (Speed Boats, Yachts, Propellor Planes, Jets, etc...)                                                       |
> [!info]
> An agent with 40% in Art and 20% in crafting would be able to create two types of art, and one type of special item. These can be defined during play. For example, upon the team running into issues procuring certain demolitions tools, the agent with 20% in craft may define that he can create explosives, and use that to help the team procure their tools.
